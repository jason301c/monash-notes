# Monash University Notes

This repository contains my personal notes from Monash University courses, written in LaTeX and Markdown.

## Structure

- Each unit has its own directory
- Notes are organized by weeks/topics
- Content is written in either LaTeX (`.tex`) or Markdown (`.md`) format

## Usage

- LaTeX files require a LaTeX compiler
- Markdown files can be viewed with any Markdown reader
- PDF versions for LaTeX are provided for easy viewing

## How to edit and compile LaTeX
- I use VSCode with LaTeX Workshop extension
- Open any .tex file, the extension will auto-detect
- Click the "Build LaTeX Project" button
- PDF output will be generated in the same directory
- View PDF directly in VSCode with side preview
